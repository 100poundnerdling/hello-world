# hello-world

Oh no...you found me. 

No! No! Don't go to a different page. Stay! I promise I'll keep it short and interesting.

My name is Kendra. I like ice cream and puppies, but who doesn't?

Some more interesting things, perhaps: I'm scrawny, but I'll beat your ass...Muay Thai, baby ;)...I love the 2nd amendment and I have a collection of tactical knives. Uou could say I have too much time on my hands, but that time chillin' in my hands dries up real quick because being bored is stupid and non-productive...neither of those I have time for.
I'm really good at spending money (girls do you feel me?). I like to decorate my home, splurge on narcissistic beauty treatments, eat expensive sushi, and buy things I never knew I needed. 
I do have a softer side...I'm on my way to being an internationally acclaimed novelist and I like crying during sad songs. My dog is my son. He's bigger than me, but hasn't killed me yet. So that's cool...
